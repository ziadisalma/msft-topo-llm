    "diameter": "Given the following definition of the diameter of a graph find the diameter of the graph that models the rooms' connections: The diameter of a connected undirected graph is the farthest distance between any two of its vertices. The diameter of a connected directed graph is the maximum possible distance between a pair of vertices, where paths must respect edge orientations, ",
    "treewidth": "Given the following definition of the treewidth of a graph find the treewidth of the graph that models the rooms' connections: Treewidth is a graph property that measures how closely a graph resembles a tree. It is defined as the number of nodes contained in the largest clique of the junction tree. A tree decomposition of a graph G is a tree T whose vertices are labelled by subsets of called bags, such that the two vertices of each edge are contained in at least one bag, and for each vertex v of G, the subgraph of T induced by the bags containing v is a connected subtree of T. The tree-width of a graph is one less than the minimum, over all tree decompositions, of the maximum bag size in that decomposition.",
    "average clustering coefficient": "Given the following definition of the average clustering  coefficient of a graph find the average clustering coefficient of the graph that models the rooms' connections: The local clustering coefficient​ of a vertex v_i in a graph G = (V, E) quantifies how close the vertex’s neighbors are to forming a complete graph (clique). For each node v_i, its neighborhood is defined asN_{i} = { v_{j} : e_{ij} \\in E \\lor e_{ji} \\in E \\} and the number of neighbors is k_{i} = |N_{i}|. The local clustering coefficient measures the proportion of possible connections among neighbors that actually exist: for a directed graph, it is given by C_{i} = \frac{ |\\{ e_{jk} : v_{j}, v_{k} \\in N_{i},\\ e_{jk} \\in E \\}| }{ k_{i}(k_{i} - 1) },  and for an undirected graph, it is C_{i} = \frac{ 2 |\\{ e_{jk} : v_{j}, v_{k} \\in N_{i},\\ e_{jk} \\in E \\}| }{ k_{i}(k_{i} - 1) }. The average clustering coefficient for the entire graph is then C = \frac{1}{|V|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|V|} C_{i}.",
    "depth":  "Given the following definition of the depth of a binary tree find the depth of the binary tree that models the rooms' connections: The depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.",
    "edge density": "Given the following definition of the edge density of a graph find the edge density of the graph that models the rooms' connections: Edge density is defined as the ratio of the number of edges in a graph to the maximum possible number of edges.",
    "Average shortest path": " Given the following definition of the average shortest path length of a graph find the average shortest path of the graph that models the rooms' connections: The average shortest path length is \\[L = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \\sum_{\\substack{s,t \\in V \\ s \neq t}} d(s,t)\\] where V is the set of nodes in G, d(s, t) is the shortest path from s to t, and n is the number of nodes in G."
